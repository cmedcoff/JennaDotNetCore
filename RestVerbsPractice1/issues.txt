* For testing, I tried inserting a TimeEntry but ran into a FK violation beasue
  of the UserId, so I've commented out the UserId in the TimeEntry entity, and
  the User entity as well.  May put them back in later, but for now, I just need
  to make this simpler to test.

* I ran into issues at runtime when I two ctor's for the context, I've commented
  one to get around this, consider investigating later.  I need a default (no
  argument) ctor for the EF migrations to work, but I may also need a ctor that
  supports dependency and/or configuration injection. Compare to some other
  project where I have that working.

* There's that EF issue where I try to perform a find before an update, and
  EF complains that the entity is already being tracked.  I've commented out
  the find, and just do the update.  I think I can do this because I'm not
  changing the PK, but I need to investigate this further.

* Need to add validation!

* Getting compiler warnings, because of the name of the latest migration?  Try
  removing and re-adding it?

* What about async?

* There's still the whole issue of having a DTO that "mirrors" the entity, and
  then having to map between the two.  Should consider cleaning this up as well.

* it's interesting that the apicontroller template generates a controller with
a PUT verb that accepts both and id and an object.  Why not just use the id
of the object itself?  Consider going back to the Pluralsight video to see
if he explains this.  Maybe even post a question on Pluralsight for that
course or ask elsewhere?

    This may have something to with the using the route as a REST URI.  It
    uniquly identifies the resource.
